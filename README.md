# <👋 Namaste, World! />

Hey, I'm Viresh Panchal, and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I love coding for the web, mobile apps, and open source projects, but I also like music and traveling.

I learned that peace isn't just a place, but a state of mind, when I traded the bustling bazaars of Ratlam for the serene banks of the Mahi River. ✈️ 🎵 💻
